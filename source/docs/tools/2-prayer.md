# The Importance of Prayer

> Do not speak to men about God until you have spoken to God about men. (Scott Pauley)

Read James 5:16

What do you think it means to pray "effectual fervent prayers"?

What does God say is the result of us praying?

## Charles Spurgeon's "Boiler Room"

> A group of young ministers called on him one day to see the large preaching place. After showing them his massive sanctuary, Spurgeon offered to show then his “boiler room.” The guests declined but the pastor insisted. Spurgeon led them to the basement. They found about 100 people in prayer. “This,” Spurgeon said with a smile, “is my boiler room.”  Whenever Spurgeon was asked the secret of his ministry he always replied, “My people pray for me.”


  Here are some historic quotes on the importance of prayer to the ministry:

> “Men may spurn our appeals, reject our message, oppose our arguments, despise our persons, but they are helpless against our prayers.” - J. Sidlow Baxter

## The example of Jesus

Read Mark 1:35, what did Jesus do?

When did Jesus do this?

Was this during a busy season of Jesus' ministry (Look at verses 31 and 35)?

Look at these verses too and notice Jesus' spending time in prayer:

- Mark 6:46
- Luke 6:12

In Luke 11:1, what did the disciples ask Jesus to teach them? (To pray)

If Jesus needed prayer for His ministry, how much more do we?


## Other Bible examples

### The example of Moses

Read Exodus 32:9-14 and answer the following questions:
- What was God's intention for Israel? (9-10)
- What did Moses do to change that? (11)
- When Moses prayed, He argued with God, what was the main point of his argument? (12)
- What else did Moses do in his intercession that we can do to prayer? (13) (Reminded God of His promises)
- What was the result of Moses' prayer? (14)

Is this the only time Moses did this?  
Consider Numbers 14:11-13 and Deuteronomy 9:25-27 - what are the similarities of these prayers?


### The example of Paul

Read Romans 1:9.

- What did Paul do for the Romans? (mention them in prayer)
- How often did Paul do this? (without ceasing)

Look at the beginning of Paul's other epistles (Paul wrote Romans-Philemon) and list at least three other references where Paul prayed for people.


# Prayer in Practice

Consider the following tips for praying as a church:
1. Have regular times of prayer for your ministry as a part of your service.
2. Pray for one request at a time.
3. Pray with your leaders regularly.
4. Consider a prayer meeting before services.
5. Refuse to be a prayerless pastor.
