## Your Family is your first ministry

Read 1 Timothy 5:8, what does Paul say of those who do not take care of their own family?

> [!bible] [1 Timothy 5:8 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/1 Timothy+5:8?translation=kjv)
> 8. But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.

Look at the following verses, what are some of the duties that you have to your family:

1. Ephesians 5:25 (Love and sacrifice for your wife)
2. Ephesians 6:4, Deuteronomy 6:7 (Instruct your children)
3. Matthew 15:6 (Take care of your parents)

These are duties of every Christian man.  We are to be examples to the flock in these areas.

## Your family qualifies you for ministry.

Read 1 Timothy 3:1-5 and Titus 1:5-9.  List the two qualifications in both of these passages regarding a pastor's family:

- They must be the husband of one wife (a faithful husband of one wife)
- They must have faithful children who are under control.

What does 1 Timothy 3:5 say about a pastor's family in relation to the church?

Think about the following quote from Pastor Kenny Kykendall, would you say this is what this passage is teaching?

> The preacher is a candidate for spiritual leadership in the church only because of his spiritual leadership in the home. (Kenny Kykendall)


If you want to be a pastor, your first responsibility is to be a good husband and dad.  If you don't get this right, nothing else will matter.

## Your family must not be neglected for your ministry.

Consider the example of two guys named John that both lived in the 1700s.

### John Wesley

John Wesley is one of the most famous preachers in history.  He was the founder of methodism and used of God to help spark the great awakening in the 1700s - but he was a terrible husband.

He and his wife Molly HATED each other.  He would spend as much time as possible away preaching because he didn't want to be home with her.  

One time, a visitor walked into John Wesley's home and found Molly dragging her husband across the room by his hair.  John wrote this to his wife "If you were buried just now, or if you had never lived, what loss would that be to the cause of God?"

After 20 years of marriage, Molly left her husband.  John wrote in his journal "I did not forsake her, I did not dismiss her, I will not recall her."

For all of the good John Wesley did, his marriage life was a mess.  He left no children and left a terrible example.

Now, consider one of his contemporaries:

### Jonathan Edwards

Jonathan Edwards was another famous pastor from the same time period.  Edwards married Sarah Pierpont when he was 24 and by all accounts, they had a fantastic married life together.  Despite his hectic schedule, he spent as much time with her and his family as he could.  They had family devotions together every day.

They raised 11 children.  Consider this legacy.  Jonathan Edwards decedents included:
- 13 College presidents
- 65 college professors
- 75 military officers
- 80 public servants
- 60 authors
- 60 doctors
- 30 judges
- 100 pastors
- 100 lawyers 
- 3 U.S. Senators
- 1 U.S. Vice President

Even if Edwards never pastored a church, never wrote a book and no one knew his name - you would have a hard time finding anyone in the world who had more of an impact than he did just with his family.

Edwards said:

> "Family education and order are some of the chief means of grace; if these are duly maintained, all the means of grace are likely to prosper and become effectual.”


DO NOT NEGLECT YOUR FAMILY.  

## Your family can be a great tool for your ministry.

### They can help in your ministry

> [!bible] [1 Corinthians 16:15 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/1 Corinthians+16:15?translation=kjv)
> 15. I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and
that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints,)

What did Paul say Stephanas' family was addicted to in 1 Corinthians 16:15?

My family is very involved in the ministry of our church.
- My wife runs our sound board, acts as a church secretary, helps lead our Awana program.
- My oldest children help teach children's classes and are involved in church music.
- My 10 year old son is always praying for and talking to the widows in our church.

### They should help as an example

If some lost person were to ask "How should a Christian treat his wife?" They ought to be able to look to you and say "Look at my pastor."  If they ask "How should a Christian raise his kids?"  They ought to be able to point to you and see an example.

Your family can lead the way and be an example of serving Jesus together - that is a powerful thing and may be more powerful in the long run than any message your preach.
